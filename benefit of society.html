    <button class="accordion">1. Water Quality Improvement</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Watershed management helps in preserving and enhancing water quality by preventing pollution, sedimentation, and contamination of water bodies. This ensures a safe and sustainable water supply for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use.</p>
        <p>Additionally, improved water quality supports aquatic ecosystems, enhances recreational opportunities, and protects public health.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">2. Flood Control and Mitigation</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Proper watershed management reduces the risk of floods by implementing strategies such as afforestation, soil conservation, and stormwater management. This protects communities and infrastructure from the devastating impacts of flooding, including property damage and loss of life.</p>
        <p>Effective flood control measures also minimize erosion, maintain soil fertility, and safeguard agricultural productivity.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">3. Ecosystem Restoration</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Watershed management plays a vital role in restoring and preserving natural ecosystems, including wetlands, forests, and riparian areas. Healthy ecosystems provide essential services such as habitat for wildlife, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation.</p>
        <p>Ecosystem restoration enhances resilience to climate change, promotes sustainable land use practices, and supports cultural heritage and traditional knowledge.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">4. Sustainable Agriculture</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>By promoting soil conservation, water efficiency, and sustainable land use practices, watershed management supports resilient and productive agricultural systems. This ensures food security, preserves rural livelihoods, and reduces environmental degradation associated with agriculture.</p>
        <p>Sustainable agriculture practices also enhance soil health, increase crop yields, and reduce reliance on chemical inputs, benefiting both farmers and consumers.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">5. Recreation and Tourism</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Well-managed watersheds offer opportunities for recreational activities such as fishing, boating, hiking, and wildlife watching. Tourism based on natural attractions contributes to local economies, job creation, and cultural preservation.</p>
        <p>Ecotourism initiatives promote environmental education, foster community engagement, and raise awareness about the importance of watershed conservation.</p>
